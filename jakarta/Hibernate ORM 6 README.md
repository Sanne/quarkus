# Migration to Hibernate ORM 6

Attempting to migrate to Hibernate ORM 6 is a follow up to the migration to Jakarta:
the scripts are *assuming* the transformation to Jakarta was already successfully applied
to the whole project.

*No checks are being done at this time*

This process is in initial phases and will not result in a functional project;
it most likely won't even compile. Its purpose is to make it possible to collaborate
on experimentation and small steps of the ongoing migration.
